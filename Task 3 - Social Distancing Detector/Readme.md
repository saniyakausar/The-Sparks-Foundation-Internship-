Social distancing is a method used to control the spread of contagious diseases.

As the name suggests, social distancing implies that people should physically distance themselves from one another, reducing close contact, and thereby reducing the spread of a contagious disease (such as coronavirus)


The steps to build a social distancing detector include:

1) Apply object detection to detect all people (and only people) in a video stream 
2) Compute the pairwise distances between all detected people
3) Based on these distances, check to see if any two people are less than N pixels apart
